## Machine Learning Vision System: Description of Work


Two tasks during this work period were to create a dataset for the model and implement a solution to classify the color of the resistor bands.

To create the dataset, we needed to collect and label images. To collect images, we used a logitech c922 webcam to collect 118 images of resistors. These images were of varying resolution from 640x480, 1280x720, 4032x3024. What we found was that while the accuracy of the model increased with image resolution, so did the inference time. As a result, we have decided to stay at 640x480 to reduce the inference time since this is a real time sorting application. After collecting the images, we used LabelImg, an open source data labeling tool, to label our images according to the XML Pascal Voc format. We had two approaches when labeling the data. The first was to have 11 classes, and label each resistor band by its color. Our motivation behind this approach was for the model to detect the resistor band and determine the color of the resistor at the same time. Our second approach was to have only one class, and have the model only detect resistor bands. An example labeled image from each approach can be seen below.

From our first approach, we labeled all 118 images to detect the resistor bands and the color. We then trained the model and performed inference on test images. What we found was that the model was in fact able to detect not only the resistor bands, but also the band color. The model however has a low accuracy and was not able to consistently detect all resistor bands.

For our second approach, we labeled all 118 images to only detect the resistor bands. We then trained the model and performed inference on the same test images as approach one. We saw that the model was consistently able to detect all bands in a resistor and with high accuracy. The downside was the model was not able to detect the color of the bands.

We decided to continue with the second approach due to the higher and more consistent accuracy. This forced us to come up with a new way to detect the color of the bands. See an example inference of each approach below.



After researching different approaches to detecting colors in an image, we decided to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm. KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to solve classification or regression problems. In our scenario, we have 10 classes, each representing a possible band color. We then collected data for each band color and used it to train the model. We then performed inference and as seen in the figure below, all colors were correctly identified. 


Additionally, we wanted to test if our model is able to detect multiple resistors. We need this feature to determine if multiple resistors went through the separator. If this scenario is detected, we need to move the resistors into a recycle bin to be put through the sorter again. Below is an example result that showcases two resistors being detected. Here, the number of bands is greater than 5 which is an indicator we will use to determine if multiple resistors passed the sorter.


## Machine Learning Vision System: Next Steps & Anticipated Challenges

Our next steps is to read the following paper, https://pub.tik.ee.ethz.ch/students/2014-HS/GA-2014-02.pdf, and  attempt to implement the median and gaussian blur used for image preprocessing in order to remove noise and improve model accuracy.

As for anticipated challenges, the inference time is still too long. The average total inference time is around 14s which would not allow us to meet our current goal of 6 resistors per minute. I believe using tiling is the reason the inference is long. Tiling is an approach used in small object detection which has improved our model accuracy at the cost of time complexity. We will put efforts into reducing this inference time by analyzing and changing the model architecture and inference pipeline.


## Fault-Detecting Neural Network

In preparation for implementing the fault-detecting neural network once the automated sorting device has been assembled, over the past two weeks, we’ve researched several candidate deep learning models with which to implement the fault-detecting neural network. If the neural network needed only to be able to distinguish between normal operation (no fault detected) and abnormal operation (a fault is detected) then a binary classifier model, i.e. a model that delivers one of two possible outputs, could be used. However, we would also prefer that the neural network not only be able to determine if a fault has occurred, but also what kind of fault occurred. To do this, the model must instead be a multi-classifier model, where the model’s output belongs to one of several classes; for instance, being able to distinguish between whether a fault occurred at the separator system, or a fault occurred at the delivery system or no fault occurred, etc.

Of the variety of multi-classifier deep learning models considered, the most promising is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. The MLP’s feedforward architecture is relatively simple to implement, yet can be built with sufficient complexity (by adding additional hidden layers of neurons) to create a complex and high-performing predictive model. Other candidate model architectures were also considered, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is well-suited to handling temporal data. However, these models are significantly more complicated to design and train, and for our particular classification problem, we deem that whatever gains in model accuracy and stability provided by an LSTM looks to be insufficient to justify the added complexity required to implement and train the model.


## PLC Configuration and Lab Access
One setback encountered this past week was a delay in receiving access to the Omron PLC Lab. After submitting the required paperwork at the beginning of the semester, we anticipated receiving access to the lab no later than 9/6. As beginning work on configuring the PLC, which controls the sorting device, is necessarily contingent on first receiving access to the Omron Lab, we will need to prioritize gaining lab access this coming week.


## Component Fabrication

These first two weeks, our focus has been purchasing materials and preparing for the build on September 30th. We bought the aluminum for the main shaft, and met with the machinist to confirm our plan. By the 7th, we had delivered supplies to have the shaft machined; however, the machinist informed us that their CNC was down and they couldn’t make our shaft as designed by the 30th. So, we are meeting with the machinist next week to determine a design that can be made with our constraints. Below is our previous design and now our proposed redesign. Notice that instead of having slots for the 3D printed bins to slot into, we’ve replaced it with holes, which will hopefully avoid having to use the CNC.
