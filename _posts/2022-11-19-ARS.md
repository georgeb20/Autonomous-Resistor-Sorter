## MLVS

An attempt was made to increase the color accuracy of the MLVS system during this work period. As mentioned in previous blogs, the color classification is based on k nearest neighbors. Initially, we picked a K value of 3, as this is the most common K value used. In order to make sure we were picking the k value that resulted in the minimal error rate, we wrote a script that picks k values between 1-100 and calculates the accuracy. After running the script, it was found that the optimal k value for our application was indeed 3. See the graph below for a k-value vs accuracy plot. The k value of 3 resulted in the optimal accuracy of 64% on our test dataset.

The next issue identified was making sure that the camera was focused when taking pictures to inference. We developed and implemented a simple algorithm to determine if the camera is in focus. Essentially, we took the average of subsequent image frames and waited until there was a small difference for 5 concurrent frames. After 5 concurrent frames with a low difference, it was safe to assume that the camera was focused and ready to capture a new frame. This added overhead to our inference time because due to the environment being unstable due to lighting and motion, it would often take the camera over half a second to focus. We observed no noticeable change to the accuracy by implementing focus to the camera. 
The problem we were still facing was the color classifier was classifying all the bands as white. We decided to investigate further by capturing a live view of the device and motoring what the camera was exactly seeing. Below is an example captured frame.

As seen in the image, the frame is flooded with white light. Specifically, the middle of the color bands is white. The knn algorithm looks at the middle color of the bands to determine the colors. As a result, it can be safely assumed that the white light is a major cause of the low accuracy. 
We are now in the process of manufacturing and fitting a cover for the camera to have a controlled lighting environment for the resistors. We hope this will greatly improve the accuracy of the MLVS.
