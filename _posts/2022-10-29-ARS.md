## Resistor Separation Subsystem
The finalization of the separation subsystem circuit has been completed, including the code and installation of the parts. For organization, the cables shown in the Figure 1 have been extended. Initially, these extensions were soldered but not covered with electrical tape in order to verify that the extensions work correctly before being permanently sealed.

However, complications arose due to the exposed soldering points on the wires between the motor and the control circuit. During the first rounds of testing after the additional wire was added, the positive and negative wires' exposed points contacted one another. This caused a short that burnt out the circuit connection between the two points, after which the circuit no longer worked. Appropriate circuit analysis was then performed to verify that the damaged was confined to that connection only. Once this was confirmed, a bridge was added in parallel to connect the two damaged points, after which, the circuit was function correctly once again.

With the return of function of the vibration circuit, simple case testing could begin. A basic version of the designed setup was constructed on a breadboard. Resistors of varying sizes were then dropped by hand to assess that the system works appropriately. The following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gn49cvh90hivkk7/IMG_2308.MOV?dl=0) is to a Dropbox video giving a demonstration of the basic circuit testing.
 
After basic testing was completed, physical and electrical components were then combined for subsystem tests. This required purchasing the last component of the separation subsystem: a flex clamp mount to hold the laser pointer which allows the system to detect when a resistor has dropped from the separator.

The final testing found that some resistors with larger leads would trigger the trip function early. However, after several adjustments and retests, an analog value that minimized both early tripping and miss trips was found.

## Conveyor Belt, Storage & Delivery System Integration
For the Storage and Delivery System, we reached completion of our subsystem testing. We have completed the physical assembly for the system, the integrating the microcontroller sorting logic, and the testing of the individual sub-system with the conveyor belt. The delivery + storage subsystem still has some construction to complete, such as organizing the electrical components into a more user-friendly configuration, and printing the remaining 3D parts. However, these portions can and will be addressed over the next 3 weeks, during integration and the training of the neural network.

When integrating the physical components of the subsystem with the microcontroller logic, we had to overcome a number of challenges. Most pressing was that initially, and contrary to our calculations, the chosen motor was not capable of turning the aluminum shaft built to hold the resistor storage bins. After further investigation, we found that this was because there was excessive friction between the shaft and the thrust bearings, upon which the aluminum cylinder rests. To allow the shaft to rotate more freely on the bearings, we used a router to level the surface of the wooden platform holding the cylinder in place, distributing the considerable weight of the aluminum cylinder evenly over the bearings. We also oiled the bearings to further reduce friction. Finally, the coupler that connects the cylinder to the motor shaft was affixed to the shaft slightly off-center. Therefore, the motor shaft was not aligned perfectly with the rotational axis of the aluminum shaft, which caused the shaft to bind against the wooden platform during a portion of its rotation. To account for this, we slightly loosened the motor mount from the wooden frame, creating a small amount of play to allow the motor to follow the circumference of the small circle traced by the cylinder as it rotates. Once these corrections were implemented the motor was able to rotate the cylinder successfully.

During the testing of the subsystem, we've determined that the delivery and storage subsystem can store a resistor approximately every 4 seconds, giving the Machine Learning Vision System (MLVS) an extra 8 seconds to determine the value of the resistor. The following figures illustrate the current progress on the delivery and storage subsystem construction:

## Machine Learning Vision System
As discussed in the future steps of Blog #2, the main focus of the MLVS was to create a final dataset and deploy the model on to the Google Coral. Another focus was to create and design a way to identify the colors of the bands.
For the band color classification problem, the first approach was to use an image classification model to classify the 11 different colors. Unfortunately, the model suffered from overfitting and delivered lackluster results. Furthermore, the risk with the proposed approach discussed in Blog 2 was a reality as the cache on the google coral was not large enough to support two models. The loss function was not converging and resulted in a model accuracy of 21%. The second approach was to use a machine learning algorithm known as k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) to classify the colors. This is a statistical algorithm, not a model, and does not rely on parameter caching which avoids the risk mentioned in Blog 2. We decided this was our best approach and selected it for our color identification task. 
With our band detection model selected and band color classification algorithm selected, it was time to collect our final datasets. We created a MATLAB script to capture 500 images of resistors from the ECE Lab using a Logitech c922 webcam. This script is under Resistor_Capture.m at this repository (https://github.com/georgeb20/AutonomousResistorSorter). The process for collecting images for the band detection model is the same as discussed in previous blogs. For the band color classification model, a python script was made to save the band crops of the labeled band images so we can use them for the color identification model. We gathered 30 color crops for each of the 11 colors leaving us with 330 images for the color classification dataset. We then used Roboflow, an online data augmentation tool to generalize our dataset by rotating images, applying flips, and creating new data from our existing data. Thus, the final dataset contains 1500 image examples for our band detection model and 990 images for the band color classification model.

We then trained the band detection model using our images and ended up with a decent mAP of 29.3%. As for our KNN model, we ended up with an initial accuracy of 48% but with tweaks to the k parameter and image preprocessing, we were able to get it up to 67%.
Finally, we created an inference script to perform live inference on the Google Coral. The algorithm of the pipeline script is as follows.

After an image frame is captured, it gets sent to a function to make sure it is a good photo. This function checks if there is something new in the frame. If there is, the frame is then sent to the band detection model, then the color detection model, and finally the function that returns the resistance.

The MLVS is working as expected, however it is suffering from low accuracy. This is due to the color classification having an accuracy of 67%. The work period from Oct 29-Nov 19 will be used to increase the color classificationâ€™s accuracy and also integrate the MLVS with the other subsystems. Currently, we plan on using a HC-05 bluetooth module to communicate between the microcontroller controlling the delivery system and the Google Coral, to send the resistance information between devices.
